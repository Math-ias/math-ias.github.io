      programmer and business president (fundraising).
    </div>
    <h3 id="technologies">Technologies</h3>
    <p>I‚Äôve been programming for about a decade.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In 2012 I first started programming in <strong><a href=
        "https://lua.org">lua</a></strong> to make games in
        <a href="https://roblox.com">Roblox</a><sup>1</sup>. I
        inspected <a href=
        "https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Free_model">‚ÄúFree
        Models‚Äù</a> of scripts others created and practiced
        changing snippets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In 2013 I got into web programming<sup>2</sup>. I
        deployed lots of little <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a>
        stacks on the family desktop and free webhosts. This gave
        me an early introduction to <strong>SQL, PHP, JavaScript
        (notably with <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a>), and
        CSS</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In 2014 I learned <strong>Python</strong>. Python was
        great for <a href="https://github.com/Math-ias/scdr">quick
        scripts to assist with homework</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In 2014 I also learned <strong>Java</strong>. Java was
        one of two options to program robots for First Robotics
        Competition<sup>3</sup>. As a team we used the <a href=
        "https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html">
        Command-Based Programming</a> paradigm. To collaborate with
        the team I also became proficient in Git<sup>4</sup>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In 2017 and 2018 I turned my web stack experience and
        connections into dev-ops summer internships. I got to use
        <strong><a href="https://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on the Ruby
        on Rails stack</a>, Chef, and <a href=
        "https://sensu.io">Sensu</a></strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In 2018 I started college and learned <strong><a href=
        "https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a></strong> and more
        importantly <strong>functional-programming</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In 2020 I worked my first co-op work experience in app
        development. On the front-end we used <a href=
        "https://flutter.dev">Flutter</a>. In the backend, we used
        <strong>Express, and React</strong> for both API and
        internal dashboards.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In 2021 I worked at <a href=
        "https://www.smartleaf.com">SmartLeaf</a> and gained new
        experiences in <strong>(Oracle) SQL, and Redux</strong>. I
        could re-use my Ruby on Rails experience as well.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In 2022 I started work at <a href=
        "https://chaossearch.io">ChaosSearch</a>. This gave me
        experience with <strong><a href=
        "https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a></strong>. We used
        <strong><a href=
        "https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/current/typed/actors.html">
        Akka Actors</a>, <a href=
        "https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/current/typed/guide/modules.html#streams">
        Akka Streams</a>, and <a href=
        "https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a></strong> to make
        <strong>distributed systems</strong>. We debugged our JVM
        app with tools like <strong><a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-4/jfr-runtime-guide/about.htm#JFRUH170">
        JFR</a>, <a href=
        "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visualvm/visualvm.java.net.backup/master/www/heapdump.html">
        VisualVM</a>, and <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/index.html">
        Java Agents</a></strong>. We created <strong><a href=
        "https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform">terraform</a></strong>
        providers. And we made custom <strong><a href=
        "https://spark.apache.org/">spark</a></strong> data
        formats.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <p>(1) Back then it was just a shareable game-engine. The
      business model has since become <a href=
      "https://fourweekmba.com/roblox-business-model/#Value_proposition_to_Developers_and_Creators">
      more complex</a>.</p>
      <p>(2) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0596515863/">Brett
      McLaughlin‚Äôs Book PHP & MySQL: The Missing Manual</a> was the
      first programming book I ever owned.</p>
      <p>(3) Outside of FRC, Java was also my first step outside
      Roblox for game development. And of course, the <a href=
      "https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/Robot.html">
      java.awt.Robot</a> class was great for pranks.</p>

      "https://www.amazon.com/Git-Pocket-Guide-Working-Introduction/dp/1449325866">
      Git Pocket Guide: A Working Introduction</a> has been
      influential to my git workflow. Commit often, rebase and
      squash before pushing, and make decision-capturing
      messages.</p>

    <h3 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h3>
    <p>I consider myself very fortunate to have had early work
    experience. I‚Äôve included my prouder moments.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In 2017 and 2018 I worked at <a href=
        "https://www.cloudhealthtech.com">CloudHealth
        technologies</a> during high school summer breaks in a
        DevOps role.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I led a cross-team design of a <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy">
            Content-Security-Policy</a> header to harden the
            company app against XSS-attacks.
          </li>
          <li>I deployed custom sensu code to create JIRA tickets
          for low-hanging infrastructure events. Something like
          <a href=
          "https://github.com/Yelp/sensu_handlers/blob/954c1962ec399031e2bb95e37b238564f644fb70/files/jira.rb">
            this from yelp</a> but with different functionality to
            cut down on duplicates.
          </li>
          <li>I mucked around in configuration (e.g nginx site
          rules, and systemd services).</li>
          <li>I prepared the company monolith <a href=
          "https://docs.chef.io/cookbooks/">Chef cookbooks</a> for
          operating system upgrades. There was a lot of updating,
          and patching shared dependencies.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In 2020 I worked at <a href=
        "https://www.solarialabs.com">Liberty Mutual‚Äôs Solaria
        Labs</a> on the <a href=
        "https://www.dwellbeingapp.com">Dwellbeing app</a> as my
        first Northeastern work experience.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I designed a <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">
            role-based access control system</a> for internal sites
            to enable and limit access to customer data.
          </li>
          <li>I investigated, replicated, and patched
          user-discovered bugs with long tails stretching between
          UI and the back-end.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In 2021 I worked at <a href=
        "https://www.smartleaf.com">SmartLeaf</a> as my second and
        last Northeastern work-experience.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I navigated the company‚Äôs large (rails) codebases.
          SmartLeaf has up to <strong>two decades of history in
          some repositories</strong>.</li>
          <li>I designed and implemented APIs to help large clients
          automate workflows.</li>
          <li>I chased down some crazy bugs down to <a href=
          "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#concept-fe-dirty">
            HTML input ‚Äúdirty values‚Äù</a>, database caching, and
            nested database transactions.
          </li>
          <li>I learned <strong>how to get stuff done</strong>.
          SmartLeaf uses resources judiciously and taught me to
          make the practical decision (which isn‚Äôt always
          perfect).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
      <li>In 2022 I graduated college and after taking a brief
      vacation got to work at ChaosSearch in June. Here I was a
      ‚Äúcore‚Äù engineer working on the backend of a
      <strong>distributed search and analytics database</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>I joined a churning ‚Äúwindowed monitoring‚Äù project.
          Here, <strong>I helped get implementation<sup>5</sup> and
          a complete internal rollout over the line</strong>. By
          connecting ingestion directly to our query engine
          (skipping index traversal), we could monitor on just the
          latest data, and provide huge compute
          savings<sup>6</sup>.</li>
          <li>I headed an effort to modernize our deployment and
          application APIs with best <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">RESTful</a>
          practices. This was my part in a larger effort to develop
          OEM opportunities.
          </li>
          <li>I <strong>headed a significant effort to <a href=
          "https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/dd2ee2400e85dc25ce1de12851b27704ed735417/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/interfaces.scala#L54-L63">
            connect spark</a> to SAAS ingested data to open
            opportunities in <a href=
            "https://docs.databricks.com/">Databricks</a> and
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/">Amazon
            EMR</a></strong>.
            <ul>
              <li>I implemented a crazy and brilliant idea from one
              of my colleagues. To break into a rather locked down
              databricks runtime, we used a java instrumentation
              agent to modify bytecode as it was loading. We
              modified databricks libraries to allow us to call
              into our own library code. <a href=
              "./tacobelljavap.html">I‚Äôve written more about
              bytecode here</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I was also happy to <strong>contribute to open source
          projects</strong> during this time.
            <ul>
              <li>Either to <a href=
              "https://github.com/apache/pekko-http/pull/146">help
              library dependencies stable release milestones</a>.
              </li>
              <li>Or to further <a href=
              "https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10881">my own
              understanding of the tools we used</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I started a running tradition that‚Äôs outlasted even
          my own interest in distance races. <a href=
          "./running/mayflower.html">You can read about the first
          event we did here</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="small">
      <p>(5) Implementation touched all sorts of interesting
      technology that ChaosSearch had developed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A distributed query engine that spread work across
        hundreds of nodes.</li>
        <li>A sophisticated query optimizer to rewrite and
          <a href="https://www.dremio.com/wiki/predicate-pushdown/">
          pushdown</a> parts of a query.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>(6) These savings were so significant that we could turn
      on old alerts. We wrote new alerts for faults in ingestion.
      We could even ring phones 15x faster (running every quarter
      of an hour to every minute!)</p>
