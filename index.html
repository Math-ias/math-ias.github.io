<h2 id="programmer-mini-mathematician-cookie-clicker-speedrunner">Programmer, mini-mathematician, cookie-clicker-speedrunner</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Mathias Kools.
I am a Belgian-American ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ from the Boston area.</p>
<h2 id="resume">Resume</h2>
<p>This is basically a different take on my resume.</p>
<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<ul>
<li>I graduated from <a href="https://www.reading.k12.ma.us/memorial/">Reading Memorial High School</a> ðŸš€ (2014 - 2018).
<ul>
<li>I recieved Valedictorian, Presidential Gold Award, and Patrick A. Schettini Award honors<sup>0</sup>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I graduated summa cum laude with a <a href="https://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/computer-information-science/computer-information-science-combined-majors/computer-science-mathematics-bs/">combined Computer Science and Mathematics degree</a> at Northeastern (2018-2022).
<ul>
<li>I finished Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Systems, Object Oriented Design and Algorithms.</li>
<li>Additionally, I studied Dynamic Models, Combinatorics, Complex Variables, and Statistics and Stochastic Processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<small>(0) I&rsquo;m also proud to be an alum of <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">First Robotics Competition team 4761</a>.
My most significant roles were business president and programmer.</small>
<h3 id="technologies">Technologies</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming for about a decade.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 2012 I first started programming in <strong><a href="https://lua.org">lua</a></strong> to make games in <a href="https://roblox.com">Roblox</a><sup>1</sup>.
I inspected <a href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Free_model">&ldquo;Free Models&rdquo;</a> of scripts others created and practiced changing snippets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2013 I got into web programming<sup>2</sup>.
I deployed lots of little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> stacks on the family desktop and free webhosts.
This gave me an early introduction to <strong>SQL, PHP, JavaScript (notably with <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a>), and CSS</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2014 I learned <strong>Python</strong>.
Python was great for <a href="https://github.com/Math-ias/scdr">quick scripts to assist with homework</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2014 I also learned <strong>Java</strong>.
Java was one of two options to program robots for First Robotics Competition<sup>3</sup>.
As a team we used the <a href="https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html">Command-Based Programming</a> paradigm.
To collaborate with the team I also became proficient in Git<sup>4</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2017 and 2018 I turned my web stack experience and connections into dev-ops summer internships.
I got to use <strong><a href="https://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on the Ruby on Rails stack</a>, Chef, and <a href="https://sensu.io">Sensu</a></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2018 I started college and learned <strong><a href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a></strong> and more importantly <strong>functional-programming</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020 I worked my first co-op work experience in app development.
On the front-end we used <a href="https://flutter.dev">Flutter</a>.
In the backend, we used <strong>Express, and React</strong> for both API and internal dashboards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2021 I worked at <a href="https://www.smartleaf.com">SmartLeaf</a> and gained new experiences in <strong>(Oracle) SQL, and Redux</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2022 I started work at <a href="https://chaossearch.io">ChaosSearch</a>. This will expose me to tools like <strong>Scala, and Akka</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<small><p>(1) Back then it was just a shareable game-engine. The business model has since become <a href="https://fourweekmba.com/roblox-business-model/#Value_proposition_to_Developers_and_Creators">more complex</a>.</p>
<p>(2) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0596515863/">Brett McLaughlin&rsquo;s Book PHP &amp; MySQL: The Missing Manual</a> was the first programming book I ever owned.</p>
<p>(3) Outside of FRC, Java was also my first step outside Roblox for game development.
And of course, the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/Robot.html">java.awt.Robot</a> class was great for pranks.</p>
<p>(4) The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Git-Pocket-Guide-Working-Introduction/dp/1449325866">Git Pocket Guide: A Working Introduction</a> has been influential to my git workflow.
Commit often, rebase and squash before pushing, and make decision-capturing messages.</p>
</small>
<h3 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h3>
<p>I consider myself very fortunate to have had early work experience.
I&rsquo;ve included my prouder moments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 2017 and 2018 I worked at <a href="https://www.cloudhealthtech.com">CloudHealth technologies</a> during high school summer breaks in a DevOps role.</p>
<ul>
<li>I led a cross-team design of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy">Content-Security-Policy</a> header to harden the company app against XSS-attacks.</li>
<li>I deployed custom sensu code to create JIRA tickets for low-hanging infrastructure events.
Something like <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/sensu_handlers/blob/954c1962ec399031e2bb95e37b238564f644fb70/files/jira.rb">this from yelp</a> but with different functionality to cut down on duplicates.</li>
<li>I mucked around in configuration (e.g nginx site rules, and systemd services).</li>
<li>I prepared the company monolith <a href="https://docs.chef.io/cookbooks/">Chef cookbooks</a> for operating system upgrades.
There was a lot of updating, and patching shared dependencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020 I worked at <a href="https://www.solarialabs.com">Liberty Mutual&rsquo;s Solaria Labs</a> on the <a href="https://www.dwellbeingapp.com">Dwellbeing app</a> as my first Northeastern work experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>I designed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">role-based access control system</a> for internal sites to enable and limit access to customer data.</li>
<li>I investigated, replicated, and patched user-discovered bugs with long tails stretching between UI and the back-end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2021 I worked at <a href="https://www.smartleaf.com">SmartLeaf</a> as my second and last Northeastern work-experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>I navigated the company&rsquo;s large (rails) codebases. SmartLeaf has up to <strong>two decades of history in some repositories</strong>.</li>
<li>I designed and implemented APIs to help large clients automate workflows.</li>
<li>I chased down some crazy bugs down to <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#concept-fe-dirty">HTML input &ldquo;dirty values&rdquo;</a>,
database caching, and nested database transactions.</li>
<li>I learned <strong>how to get stuff done</strong>.
SmartLeaf uses resources judiciously and taught me to make the practical decision (which isn&rsquo;t always perfect).</li>
</ul>
