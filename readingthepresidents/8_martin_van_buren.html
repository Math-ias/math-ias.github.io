    <p>For Martin Van Buren I read book number 8 from <a href=
    "https://us.macmillan.com/series/theamericanpresidents">The
    American Presidents Series</a> published by MacMillan: <a href=
    "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/martin-van-buren-ted-widmer/1015777961">
    Martin Van Buren by Ted Widmer</a>.</p>
    <p>Widmer does his best with what he’s left. <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papers_of_Martin_Van_Buren">Martin
    Van Buren chose to destroy a large amount of his personal and
    political correspondence</a>, leaving us with less letters than
    say a John Quincy Adams and a rambling autobiography he starts
    in an elder age. It’s a bit of a shame because I think Van
    Buren’s story is the most relatable of all the presidents I’ve
    read about so far. Here is a man who defeated destiny.</p>
    <p>By all accounts, he was supposed to remain an odd dutch
    country bumpkin in <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinderhook,_New_York">Kinderhook,
    New York</a> and marry his cousin<sup>0</sup>. But by jumping
    through every door that became open to him he became a titan of
    1800s politics. The journey was long. Lawyer’s apprentice,
    lawyer, state senate, war of 1812 advocate, NY Attorney
    General, “Bucktails” political party leader, US senator,
    hand-shaker, alliance-maker, and now part of Jackson’s
    cabinet.</p>
    <div class="small">
      (0) And I’m not being crass! This is something Widmer notes
      as not uncommon in that town.
    </div>
    <p>Along the way he defeated people who were supposed to win
    politically like DeWitt Clinton and John Calhoun. Jackson chose
    him as his Vice President for his second term, the culmination
    of a carefully cultivated alliance, and Van Buren had made
    himself inevitable. In 1836 Van Buren reached the pinnacle of
    his ambition, he was president of the United States.</p>
    <p>Only at the heights he was never supposed to reach did fate
    finally strike back. A teetering economy, <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837">uncontrollable
    without a central bank Van Buren helped kill in Jackson’s
    term</a>, fell over in the wind. Re-election? Impossible.</p>
    <p>I think Van Buren shows what’s possible without luck. And he
    inspires me to keep knocking at what feels like the limits of
    my destiny. Like Van Buren, I will not be
    remembered<sup>1</sup>. But to the people of my time, it’s
    possible to serve and be known.</p>
