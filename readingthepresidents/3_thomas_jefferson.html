    <h1 id="thomas-jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</h1>
    <p>On Thomas Jefferson I read Catherine Kerrison’s tome
    <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/252787/jeffersons-daughters-by-catherine-kerrison/">
    “Jefferson’s Daughters: Three Sisters, White and Black, in a
    Young America”</a>.</p>
    <p>Kerrison cuts through Jefferson’s mythology to show the man
    how he was in his home and with his family.</p>
    <p>What sticks with me the most is when <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Hemings">Harriet</a>,
    daughter of <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hemings">Sally
    Hemmings</a> (a slave) and Jefferson, is freed (and this is a
    remarkable moment in itself) as negotiated by Sally. She walks,
    as far as anyone knows, into southern white society to live an
    unrecorded, undiscovered, normal life. Since Jefferson was
    darker-skinned-white and Sally Hemmings was
    lighter-skinned-black, she is light enough in complexion to
    never be questioned and returned to chains. She is the ultimate
    counter-example to the Antebellum South’s idea that blacks are
    genetically inferior and divinely destined for servitude. Here
    is a black woman, according to the one drop rule, living
    amongst them, with desire for freedom, wielding that freedom,
    and them none the wiser! She smashes the idea of black and
    white at the time. And its amazing it is so intimately
    connected to one of the founding fathers who failed to live up
    to protecting the liberties he inked to paper.</p>
