    <h1 id="andrew-jackson">Andrew Jackson</h1>
    <p>On Andrew Jackson I read Teri Kanefield’s <a href=
    "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/andrew-jackson-teri-kanefield/1127659550">
    “Andrew Jackson: The Making of America #2”</a>.</p>
    <p>I found this book quite short. That might be why it’s marked
    for “middle school” readers<sup>0</sup>. It may also be for the
    reason that Andrew Jackson was not as literate and grammatical
    and prolific as presidents of the past. So maybe there’s not a
    “John Adams Journal” to dump into the pages (I’m looking at you
    McCullough).</p>
    <div class="small">
      (0) While writing reviews I came upon <a href=
      "https://bestpresidentialbios.com">this blog “My Journey
      Through the Best Presidential Biographies” with a similar
      objective</a>. If I do a <a href=
      "https://thebestbiographies.com//?s=Andrew+Jackson&amp;search=Go">
      search</a> I find a number of books that would’ve challenged
      my reading level better.
    </div>
    <p>I thought Kanefield was helpful guiding me through Jackson’s
    actions. What were his motivations? Often personal pride and
    wanting to tear down ivory towers. What did people think at the
    time? Mixed, some thought he was an outrageous character and
    some saw him as a legendary fiery character to lead them.
    Knowing these things, how can we judge his actions? Sometimes
    rightfully harshly such as his actions to push the Cherokee out
    of their native lands in Georgia or his dissolution of the
    national bank.</p>
    <p>Many other readers on this site have pointed similarities to
    President Donald Trump. I think these are apt comparisons. I
    couldn’t help but think about the incoming president when I
    read about Jackson’s “kitchen cabinet”: a group of family and
    friends he met with instead of his official cabinet. Or the
    rotating set of press secretaries. Or the incitement of crowds.
    Or his desire for loyalty. Or his ego. Or his stacking of the
    Supreme Court: picking a new chief justice much more aligned
    with strict originalism than John Marshal.</p>
    <p>When I’m an old man I look forward to Trump’s biography. I
    look forward to a more neutral look to the outrageous character
    of our time. What is madness and what are his ideas I may not
    yet understand or appreciate? Where did he come from? And how
    might we look upon his presidency with decades of space?</p>
