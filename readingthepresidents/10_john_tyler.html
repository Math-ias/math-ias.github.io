    <h1 id="john-tyler">John Tyler</h1>
    <p>I read <a href=
    "https://virginiahistory.org/learn/president-without-party">President
    without a Party: The Life of John Tyler</a> by Christopher J.
    Leahy.</p>
    <p>The number of pages suggests this would be a slog similar to
    a McCullough biography. I was pleasantly surprised though how
    the author mixed excerpts from Tyler’s letters, narration of
    the events of the 1800s, and their own interpretations of his
    behavior. By the end I felt I now completely understood Tyler
    as a person.</p>
    <p>He was brought up in the antebellum south obsessed with
    social status and “honor”. His father, a Judge, closely managed
    his career and taught him to idolize Jefferson. That particular
    ideology made him a terrible pick for <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)">the
    Whigs</a>, a new party founded as an antidote response to
    Jackson and Van Buren. On the surface he opposed Jackson. He
    found Jackson’s heavy-handed response to South Carolina’s
    <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_crisis">nullification
    crisis</a><sup>0</sup> and use of the executive veto as going
    against his strong states rights principles. Those same
    principles mean when he becomes president after Old
    Tippencanoe’s death he is suddenly the only thing standing in
    the way of large, federally-funded, internal improvements and
    most notably a central bank (suddenly that veto doesn’t feel so
    gross to him).</p>
    <div class="small">
      (0) South Carolina is extremely problematic in the 1800s,
      they were also the first state to secede.
    </div>
    <p>There are three details that stuck with me from his
    presidency.</p>
    <h2 id="bank-bill">Bank Bill</h2>
    <p>The first is that bank bill. The nation was reeling from an
    economic crash in Van Buren’s term in 1837 (a crash that killed
    his re-election chances). That crash couldn’t be managed in
    part because Andrew Jackson’s had vetoed the rechartering of
    what had been the second bank of the United States five years
    prior. The Whigs were looking to replace that central function.
    Tyler, wary of expanding the power of the federal government,
    was not going to help them. But realizing that defeating any
    attempt at making the state of the nation better would kill his
    future political ambitions (he wanted to win the presidency as
    the first choice on the ticket) he began to think of what bank
    bill he might accept.</p>
    <p>I think this moment is fascinating. Tyler begins
    communicating to lawmakers about what he wants to see in the
    bill. He is equally exact, but careful to not APPEAR as if he
    is dictating legislature. In all the biographies I’ve read so
    far this appears to be the first instance that a president is
    obsessed with the exact political narrative of his presidency.
    I think this obsession might just last through the presidents I
    was alive for. I think it ENDS in Donald Trump’s presidency and
    his use of Twitter (or Truth Social) to pierce the veil of
    presidential intentions<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    <div class="small">
      (1) And who knows. Part of that is I’ve only read presidents
      pre John Tyler, and really lived through presidents Obama and
      later.
    </div>
    <h2 id=
    "princeton-disasterhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiuss_princeton_18431844_peacemaker_accident">
    <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Princeton_(1843)#1844_Peacemaker_accident">
    Princeton Disaster</a></h2>
    <p>The second moment begins on the Potomac on February 28, 1844
    aboard the newly sailing USS Princeton. The crew is showing off
    their 27,000 pound gun. They fire it twice to the delight of
    guests, including John Tyler. They decide to do one more encore
    performance and fire it a third time.</p>
    <p>And the moment is utter chaos. The gun explodes sending
    metal shrapnel across the ship’s deck. Six people are killed
    instantly. Secretary of State Abel Upshur, Secretary of the
    Navy Thomas Walker Gilmer, US Navy Bureau of Construction and
    Repair Head Beverly Kennon, Virgil Maxcy (distinguished
    attorney), John Tyler’s valet (enslaved) Armistead, and David
    Gardiner, the father of John Tyler’s future wife Julia. In that
    moment, the United States came its closest to further stressing
    its designated line of succession. John Tyler never bothered
    selecting his own vice president. It would have fallen to
    “senate president pro-tempore” Willie Mangum.</p>
    <h2 id="mercury">Mercury</h2>
    <p>The third is the fact that John Tyler likely dies of mercury
    poisoning. His young new wife Julia Gardiner Tyler is in love
    with the quack medical industry of the time. He is fed
    “blue-pill” after pill of trace amounts of mercury to deal with
    every ailment. I consider this karma for signing up so quickly
    to the new confederacy’s congress<sup>2</sup>.</p>

      (2) Unique amongst presidents, when civil war breaks out he
      chooses to be a traitor to the union.
