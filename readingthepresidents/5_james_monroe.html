    <h1 id="james-monroe">James Monroe</h1>
    <p>On James Monroe I read Tim McGrath’s <a href=
    "https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/318900/james-monroe-by-tim-mcgrath/">
    “James Monroe: A Life”</a>.</p>
    <p>I read this book a while ago. And my memory isn’t so
    good.</p>
    <p>I do remember the author doing a wonderful job capturing the
    magic of <a href=
    "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/there-was-time-briefly-and-200-years-ago-when-american-politics-was-full-good-feelings-180964074/">
    James Monroe’s tours of the United States</a>. McGrath
    convinced me this was a president who cared for unity and
    pragmatic decisions. That Monroe saw something past party. The
    politics of the United States today are red-team, blue-team
    with little down the middle. Politicians prioritize these
    parties. And these parties prioritize ideologies.</p>
    <p>A first impression might be that we should return to leaders
    like Monroe. To unite us, stop the chaos, and keep the status
    quo. But the status quo of the 1820s was wretched slavery. And
    on that issue Monroe knew it was immoral but pragmatism pushed
    him into the financial practicality of <a href=
    "https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-enslaved-households-of-president-james-monroe">
    owning slaves himself</a>. And pragmatism pushed him away from
    the violence necessary to strip Southern slavers. And
    pragmatism put him onto an impossible, pie in the sky, idea of
    relocating slaves to a new colony in Africa.</p>
    <p>I started reading presidential biographies to see if I could
    find guiding principles to lead my own life by. These were men
    (and I hope by the time I’m reading recent presidents, women)
    who reached the pinnacle of civic ambition. Surely, they might
    all be onto some great truth that I too could follow. As I get
    deeper down the list I uncover more questions than answers.</p>
    <p>Is it better to follow paralyzing principle and bang your
    head on the rocks of societal wrongs? Or is it better to steer
    around these cliffs and find progress elsewhere, pragmatically
    kicking the proverbial can down the road for future crises.</p>
    <p>I don’t know.</p>
