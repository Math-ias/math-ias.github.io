    <p>On John Quincy Adams I read Fred Kaplan’s <a href=
    "https://www.fredkaplanbiographer.com/john-quincy-adams-american-visionary.html">
    “John Quincy Adams: American Visionary”</a>.</p>
    <p>Much like his father John Quincy Adams kept a journal to
    capture the major and minute details of his life. Much like
    McCullough, Kaplan doesn’t spare any of this writing from the
    reader. This was a slog to get through. But I come out the
    other end feeling like I really know John Quincy Adams.</p>
    <p>I found his ambition to serve the public as much as he could
    admirable. He survived past his presidency to serve in
    Congress. I found his adventures in Europe exciting. Even
    though he often was sick from the road, especially during his
    winters in imperial Russia. And I found his battle with
    religion relatable.</p>
    <p>He takes on a lot of puritan values from where he grows up.
    And he likes the contemplative benefits of prayer and
    gathering. Yet, he cannot balance the mystical powers of
    prophets with his thorough education. And so while he feels
    free to attend any house of worship, he knows he just won’t
    share the same beliefs. I think in this way and many others
    Kaplan shows how John Quincy Adams was ahead of his time.</p>
