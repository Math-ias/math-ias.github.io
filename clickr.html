    is a minigame redstone contraption.
A lectern faces the player showing a written book with nearly 100 pages.
The player’s objective is to flip through that book as fast as possible.
After reaching the last page the player’s score is readable from the number of items in the hopper.

     The original objective was to create a game about clicking as fast as possible.†

     Specifically, the original objective was to pay homage to
     <a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Gracie%27s_car">
      the car washing minigame

     from Animal Crossing.

    <li>
     trapdoors

   </ul>
   <div class="withsmall">
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">
     Were evaluated for allowing quick, readable inputs (by redstone signal or observer).
One in-the-way mechanic was that the game repeated interactions 5 times per second† if the player held the mouse button down.
    </p>
    <small>
     Testing it out in creative, in 60 seconds a trapdoor can be flipped 302 times by holding the mouse down.
That makes an approximate rate of 5 clicks per second.
    </small>
   </div>
   <div class="withsmall">
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">
     It’s of course possible to click faster than this, on a macbook trackpad I can click 7 times per second†.
Ultimately, this floor performance was too high for the gameplay to feel rewarding.
    </p>
    <small>
     Trackpad performance measured using an online click speed test. The measurement period was considerably shorter than one minute.
    </small>

   <div class="withsmall">
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">
     It was discovered that
     <strong>
      the buttons to change the current page in written books do not repeat
     </strong>
     .
Prototyping redstone† was rigged to read each discrete page turn with an observer.
    </p>
    <small>
     “Prototyping redstone” is underselling the amount of commitment given to this observer idea. I thought I had finished the game at this point, and had wired all sorts of fun interactivity with this concept. I used a redstone clock to give the player a certain amount of time, and put only a limited number of items in the dropper for the player to empty out.
    </small>
   </div>
   <p>
    That observer powered a dropper, the output of which represented the number of clicks the player had committed.
Playtesting this uncovered a new issue, however,
    <strong>
     the observers could only make so many page-turn observations per second
    </strong>

     Tested with a setup of an observer facing a lectern with a written book. The observer pulsed into a dropper which dropped items into a barrel. To click a reliable number of times a second, I wrote
     <a href="clickr/Clickr.java">
      this java code
     </a>
     to utilize the
     <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/Robot.html">
      java.awt.Robot
     </a>
     class.

   <h3 id="lecterns-emit-redstone">
    Lecterns Emit Redstone
   </h3>
   <p>
    One solution to this observation problem was not observing at all.
Instead the aggregate number of clicks could be tracked using
    <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lectern#Redstone_signal">
     the signal strength of the lectern
    </a>
    .
In this build, this signal strength is read using a comparator.
One surprising property of lecterns is that
    <strong>
     they emit a redstone signal themselves
    </strong>
    .
This pulse lasts just one game-tick and is hard to otherwise notice while playing with the book.
This unexpected property proved to be the last hiccup in completing the build.

    States

   <p>
    There are four states desired in the game.
   </p>
   <div class="withsmall">
    <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
     <li>
      The
      <strong>
       playing
      </strong>
      state.
      <ul>
       <li>
        The
        <strong>
         display
        </strong>
        hopper is
        <em>
         disabled
        </em>
        (to prevent items from flowing backwards).
       </li>
       <li>
        The
        <strong>
         feed
        </strong>
        hopper is
        <em>
         enabled
        </em>
        (to keep track of the time).
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      The
      <strong>
       finished
      </strong>
      state. This is when player’s can do victory laps and look at their time.
      <ul>
       <li>
        The display hopper is
        <em>
         disabled
        </em>
        (clean-up isn’t wanted before the player has a chance to see their score).
       </li>
       <li>
        The feed hopper is
        <em>
         disabled
        </em>
        (continued counting isn’t wanted when the game is over).
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      The
      <strong>
       clean-up
      </strong>
      state. This is when the machine resets itself.
      <ul>
       <li>
        The display hopper is
        <em>
         enabled
        </em>
        (all of the items need to get out to start the next game at 0).
       </li>
       <li>
        The feed hopper is
        <em>
         disabled
        </em>
        (would fight against clean-up).
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      The
      <strong>
       init
      </strong>
      state†. This is when the machine accepts input to go into the playing state.
      <ul>
       <li>
        It doesn’t matter what the display hopper is (all the items have been emptied out).
       </li>
       <li>
        The feed hopper is
        <em>
         disabled
        </em>
        (not playing yet so not counting).
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <small>
     <p>
      The init state isn’t strictly necessary but was included largely for bad input protection.
It was desired to …
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       stop the player from starting a new game if clean-up wasn’t done (their score would be artificially high).
      </li>
      <li>
       stop the player from starting a new game in the middle of the book (their score would be artifically low).
Checking both of these in the transition from a clean-up state to a ready state would require complicated redstone (in particular at least an AND gate).
      </li>
     </ul>
    </small>
   </div>
   <p>
    To track these four different states, two bits of memory are needed.
There are a variety of
    <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Redstone_circuits/Memory#RS_latches">
     RS latches
    </a>
    figured out on the minecraft wiki.
One latch will be called the
    <strong>
     freeze
    </strong>
    bit, and the other latch will be called the
    <strong>
     ready
    </strong>
    bit.

     NOTE that while these accomplish desired state transitions, they also implement transitions on the other side of the table.
In each case the effect is rare if not impossible to trigger†.

     The transitions themselves were chosen precisely because they were safely duplicable to the other side of the state table.
This provided the huge advantage of redstone simplicity, no logic gates were required.

     It’s possible to save one redstone tick by stretching out input to power 15 instead of using a comparator in subtract mode.
A lot of the edge detectors compatible with this choice (i.e not piston driven) use the movement of an item in a hopper/dropper combination or dropper dropper combination.
To give a little more wiggle room with placement of the edge detector, it’s suggested to use a sword as the item.
With a sword, the output strength of the edge detector will be at least power 3.

   <h3 id="the-book-itself">
    The Book Itself
   </h3>
   <p>
    The redstone power of a book in a lectern is determined by the current page and the total number of pages.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lectern#Redstone_signal">
      It’s roughly proportionate to, but not equal to exactly, the percentage progress through the book
     </a>
     .
     <ul>
      <li>
       In Java Edition, the formula is
       <code>
        FLOOR(1 + 14 (P - 1) / (M - 1) )
       </code>
       . Where
       <code>
        P
       </code>
       is the current page number and
       <code>
        M
       </code>
       is the total number of pages.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Book_and_Quill#Writing">
      Written books have a limit of 100 pages
     </a>
     .
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    This formula has some nice and some not nice properties …
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     NOT NICE: With a large
     <code>
      M
     </code>
     , the threshold between lectern power 1 and 2 (starting the game) is not at page 1, but further into the book e.g page 7 or 8.
    </li>
    <li>
     NICE: Signal power is 15 only on the last page.
     <code>
      FLOOR(1 + 14 (M - 1) / (M - 1)) = FLOOR(1 + 14) = 15
     </code>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    It is desired to find a total number of pages that results in a
    <em>
     round
    </em>
    number of clicks required to transition from the threshold of book power 2 to the end.
100 clicks is not possible after all there can only be 100 pages in a book.
Then it is worth finding a book that takes
    <em>
     90
    </em>
    clicks start (the threshold between power 1 and 2) to finish.
   </p>
   <p>
    The different possibilites can be evaluated in a spreadsheet.

    The total number of clicks comes from how it will take the user 1 click (hence the
    <code>
     + 1
    </code>
    ) to start the game.
Then
    <code>
     threshold - final page number
    </code>
    of clicks are required to reach the final page.
   </p>
   <p>
    When creating the written book, it’s recommended to create 97 pages.
The last page before the game starts will be page 7 and so 90 clicks will finish the game.

     This example was created by [a small script]({{resource_link “minecraft_color_code_converter.py”}}) to convert the Minecraft text (with formatting codes) to HTML.
On a Mac, it is possible to pipe the output right into the clipboard with
     <code>
      pbcopy
     </code>
     .

     Created in python with this snippet instead of copy-pasting it.
     <code>
      "█" * (42) + "▒" * (90 - 42)
     </code>
    </small>
   </div>
   <p>
    One huge speed up to writing progress bars was not writing the unicode characters individually with copy and paste but instead doing the entire bar as a string.
NOTE this won’t work with formatting codes, Minecraft seems to require those pasted in individually, followed by a formatting code key press.

    Reception
   </h3>
   <p>
    I deployed this game on my homeserver of
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/robm4a/thugcraft_semivanillasmp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">
     Thugcraft
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    I noticed that players were …
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     willing to, unprompted, attempt to improve their score after their first run.
    </li>
    <li>
     appreciative of the experience, enough to leave tips in the tip jar on-top the machine.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Typical scores ranged between 22 and 46 items in the display hopper.
On some first attempts players went as high as two stacks of items, it is suggested to keep that many items in the feed hopper.

    Tips and Tricks
   </h3>
   <p>
    To play the game effectively …
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Players should use more than one finger to click. I alternate clicks from my left and right pointer fingers on a physical mouse.
    </li>
    <li>
     When resetting the game, players can take the book out and put it back in to immediately jump to the beginning.
     <ul>
      <li>
       This saves stamina instead of losing it from flipping the book all the way back.
      </li>
