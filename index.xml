      <description>Reading Every Presidential Biography I’m trying to read a biography for every president of the United States. This is a directory of all my reviews.
I started this project in 2022 when I started my first full time job. I lived in Brookline and my work office was an hour away by green-line tram. At the time, I was wrestling with control.0 Sitting stuck in a metal box for two hours wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do.</description>

      <description>Andrew Jackson On Andrew Jackson I read Teri Kanefield&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Andrew Jackson: The Making of America #2&amp;rdquo;.
I found this book quite short. That might be why it&amp;rsquo;s marked for &amp;ldquo;middle school&amp;rdquo; readers0. It may also be for the reason that Andrew Jackson was not as literate and grammatical and prolific as presidents of the past. So maybe there&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;John Adams Journal&amp;rdquo; to dump into the pages (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you McCullough).</description>

      <description>John Quincy Adams On John Quincy Adams I read Fred Kaplan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;John Quincy Adams: American Visionary&amp;rdquo;.
Much like his father John Quincy Adams kept a journal to capture the major and minute details of his life. Much like McCullough, Kaplan doesn&amp;rsquo;t spare any of this writing from the reader. This was a slog to get through. But I come out the other end feeling like I really know John Quincy Adams.</description>

      <guid>http://math-ias.github.io/readingthepresidents/5_james_monroe.html</guid>
      <description>James Monroe On James Monroe I read Tim McGrath&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;James Monroe: A Life&amp;rdquo;.
I read this book a while ago. And my memory isn&amp;rsquo;t so good.
I do remember the author doing a wonderful job capturing the magic of James Monroe&amp;rsquo;s tours of the United States. McGrath convinced me this was a president who cared for unity and pragmatic decisions. That Monroe saw something past party. The politics of the United States today are red-team, blue-team with little down the middle.</description>

      <guid>http://math-ias.github.io/readingthepresidents/4_james_madison.html</guid>
      <description>James Madison On James Madison I read Noah Feldman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Three Lives of James Madison: Genius, Partisan, President&amp;rdquo;.
James Madison reminds me of a mailing list software engineer. He is obsessed with perfecting the constitutional contract. When his beloved document hits real world issues (small states refusing to sign) he is forced to compromise (senate) and back-rationalize his changes.
Obviously, I&amp;rsquo;m not the biggest fan of the president but the author deserves kudos for organizing this biography into the &amp;ldquo;3 lives&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <guid>http://math-ias.github.io/readingthepresidents/3_thomas_jefferson.html</guid>
      <description>Thomas Jefferson On Thomas Jefferson I read Catherine Kerrison&amp;rsquo;s tome &amp;ldquo;Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s Daughters: Three Sisters, White and Black, in a Young America&amp;rdquo;.
Kerrison cuts through Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s mythology to show the man how he was in his home and with his family.
What sticks with me the most is when Harriet, daughter of Sally Hemmings (a slave) and Jefferson, is freed (and this is a remarkable moment in itself) as negotiated by Sally.</description>

      <description>John Adams On John Adams I read David McCullough&amp;rsquo;s tome &amp;ldquo;John Adams&amp;rdquo;.
This is a heavy book. Literally! McCullough&amp;rsquo;s book was so hefty that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t one-hand it on the subway. McCullough does NOT hold back sharing excerpts of Adams&amp;rsquo;s writing. The second president eventually dies July 4th, page 700-something. And I emerge victorious.</description>

      <description>George Washington On George Washington I read a light and breezy book by Alexis Coe, &amp;ldquo;You Never Forget Your First&amp;rdquo;.
An easy first read to inaugurate my presidential biography project. This chronologically approached Washington&amp;rsquo;s mythos and pointed out fact from fiction. I got the impression the author didn&amp;rsquo;t care for Washington&amp;rsquo;s legendary status and wanted readers to see him more as fellow man. All my heroes are dead.</description>

      <description>Part One AND Part Two As always, read the problem text first.
In summary, this problem requires a process to unscramble segments and numbers. Each line of input contains two pieces of data &amp;hellip;
 The 7-segment display representation of all ten digits in a random order. Four of any of these digits. The number these digits build is a desired output. Part one asks for the count of specific numbers.</description>

      <description>Advent of Code 2021 in Spreadsheets Advent of Code is &amp;ldquo;an advent calendar of small programming puzzles&amp;rdquo;. Each puzzle comes with an example input and output. The site generates a unique challenge file0 for each user, and rewards them for solving it.
(0) These files dwarf the example input and output. This tests that solutions can scale. Programmers race on time to get onto a global leaderboard. I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in racing towards the bottom of technology stacks.</description>

      <description>Part One As always, read the problem text first. In summary, the input is a list of movement commands. The format of the data is &amp;lt;direction&amp;gt; &amp;lt;amount&amp;gt; where direction can be forward, down, and up0.
(0) NOTE there is no backwards. There are sometimes unsaid invariants. &amp;lt;amount&amp;gt; is always a positive integer in my challenge input. Starting at (0,0) the objective is to figure out the final position.

      <description>Foreword There was a lot of repetitive work in this challenge. Easy enough in sheets but not easy on readers. Particularly on the number of bits &amp;hellip;
 The author&amp;rsquo;s examples use 5. The challenge input used 12. The written solution will demo 3.  Part One As always, read the problem text first. In summary, the input is a list of binary numbers (of the same length). The goal is to find, for each binary place, the most and least common values.</description>

      <description>Part One AND Part Two This one is pretty funny. The author has managed to squeeze bingo into the story.
The input is both a list of numbers and boards. The goal is to figure out at which number call-out a board bingos. Part one asks for the board that bingos first. Part two asks for the one that bingos last.
Some notes &amp;hellip;
 In this version of bingo, bingo comes from completing only a row or column.</description>

      <description>Part One and Two As always, read the problem text first. In summary, the input is a list of line segments made by two points. The goal is to count the number of points where at least two lines overlap.
The data uses some simplifications &amp;hellip;
 Each line is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal (slope of 1 or -1)0. Everything happens on integer coordinates. Every line fits within a known square box.</description>

      <description>Part One AND Part Two As always, read the problem text first. In summary, the goal is to model the growth of splitting fish. At 0 days away from splitting one fish becomes two. One of the new fish is 6 days away from splitting and the second is 8 days away.
The output to part one is the total number of fish on day 80. Part two is the total number of fish on day 256.</description>

      <description>Part One And Two As always, read the problem text first. In summary, part one and two are optimization problems.
In part one the goal is to find a number (X) that minimizes the sum of distances to elements in a set (A) ∑|A - X|. The goal of part two is to minimize the square distance0 ∑((A - X)^2 + |A - X|)/2.
(0) This exact formula comes from finite arithmetic series.</description>

      <description>Part One As always, read the problem text first.
In summary, part one asks to identify “low cells” in a grid. A low cell has a value less than all cells next to it. The output takes all low cells, changes them by adding 1, and sums.
Solving Part One This solution requires multiple sheets.
Given a map of data0 &amp;hellip;
 A1=6A1=2A1=3 A1=7A1=4A1=5 A1=6A1=5A1=9 MAP  (0) Each digit gets a cell via Python.</description>
