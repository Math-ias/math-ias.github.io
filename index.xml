      <description>Taco Bell Javap Recently, I wanted to better understand a java program’s execution. I wanted to know every usage of a particular class. For example, let’s look for calls to the static method BigInteger.valueOf. I have a funny constraint though, I don’t own the source code. My solution involves looking at java bytecode.
All About That Bytecode We write java programs in syntax that&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be readable0. Here is Fibonacci1 with BigInteger&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>John Tyler I read President without a Party: The Life of John Tyler by Christopher J. Leahy.
The number of pages suggests this would be a slog similar to a McCullough biography. I was pleasantly surprised though how the author mixed excerpts from Tyler&amp;rsquo;s letters, narration of the events of the 1800s, and their own interpretations of his behavior. By the end I felt I now completely understood Tyler as a person.</description>

      <description>William Henry Harrison I read Robert M. Owen&amp;rsquo;s Mr. Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s Hammer: William Henry Harrison and the Origins of American Indian Policy.
The first presidential biography book I read in one day. This was highly rated by other presidential biography readers. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I agree.
The author Staes an intent to examine Harrison&amp;rsquo;s most impactful work not as President but as governor of Western territories leading up to and during the war of 1812.</description>

      <description>Martin Van Buren For Martin Van Buren I read book number 8 from The American Presidents Series published by MacMillan: Martin Van Buren by Ted Widmer.
Widmer does his best with what he&amp;rsquo;s left. Martin Van Buren chose to destroy a large amount of his personal and political correspondence, leaving us with less letters than say a John Quincy Adams and a rambling autobiography he starts in an elder age. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a shame because I think Van Buren&amp;rsquo;s story is the most relatable of all the presidents I&amp;rsquo;ve read about so far.</description>

      <description>Reading Every Presidential Biography I’m trying to read a biography for every president of the United States. This is a directory of all my reviews.
I started this project in 2022 when I started my first full time job. I lived in Brookline and my work office was an hour away by green-line tram. At the time, I was wrestling with control.0 Sitting stuck in a metal box for two hours wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do.</description>

      <guid>http://math-ias.github.io/readingthepresidents/7_andrew_jackson.html</guid>
      <description>Andrew Jackson On Andrew Jackson I read Teri Kanefield&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Andrew Jackson: The Making of America #2&amp;rdquo;.
I found this book quite short. That might be why it&amp;rsquo;s marked for &amp;ldquo;middle school&amp;rdquo; readers0. It may also be for the reason that Andrew Jackson was not as literate and grammatical and prolific as presidents of the past. So maybe there&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;John Adams Journal&amp;rdquo; to dump into the pages (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you McCullough).</description>

      <description>John Quincy Adams On John Quincy Adams I read Fred Kaplan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;John Quincy Adams: American Visionary&amp;rdquo;.
Much like his father John Quincy Adams kept a journal to capture the major and minute details of his life. Much like McCullough, Kaplan doesn&amp;rsquo;t spare any of this writing from the reader. This was a slog to get through. But I come out the other end feeling like I really know John Quincy Adams.</description>

      <description>James Monroe On James Monroe I read Tim McGrath&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;James Monroe: A Life&amp;rdquo;.
I read this book a while ago. And my memory isn&amp;rsquo;t so good.
I do remember the author doing a wonderful job capturing the magic of James Monroe&amp;rsquo;s tours of the United States. McGrath convinced me this was a president who cared for unity and pragmatic decisions. That Monroe saw something past party. The politics of the United States today are red-team, blue-team with little down the middle.</description>

      <guid>http://math-ias.github.io/readingthepresidents/4_james_madison.html</guid>
      <description>James Madison On James Madison I read Noah Feldman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Three Lives of James Madison: Genius, Partisan, President&amp;rdquo;.
James Madison reminds me of a mailing list software engineer. He is obsessed with perfecting the constitutional contract. When his beloved document hits real world issues (small states refusing to sign) he is forced to compromise (senate) and back-rationalize his changes.
Obviously, I&amp;rsquo;m not the biggest fan of the president but the author deserves kudos for organizing this biography into the &amp;ldquo;3 lives&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <guid>http://math-ias.github.io/readingthepresidents/3_thomas_jefferson.html</guid>
      <description>Thomas Jefferson On Thomas Jefferson I read Catherine Kerrison&amp;rsquo;s tome &amp;ldquo;Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s Daughters: Three Sisters, White and Black, in a Young America&amp;rdquo;.
Kerrison cuts through Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s mythology to show the man how he was in his home and with his family.
What sticks with me the most is when Harriet, daughter of Sally Hemmings (a slave) and Jefferson, is freed (and this is a remarkable moment in itself) as negotiated by Sally.</description>

      <description>John Adams On John Adams I read David McCullough&amp;rsquo;s tome &amp;ldquo;John Adams&amp;rdquo;.
This is a heavy book. Literally! McCullough&amp;rsquo;s book was so hefty that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t one-hand it on the subway. McCullough does NOT hold back sharing excerpts of Adams&amp;rsquo;s writing. The second president eventually dies July 4th, page 700-something. And I emerge victorious.</description>

      <description>George Washington On George Washington I read a light and breezy book by Alexis Coe, &amp;ldquo;You Never Forget Your First&amp;rdquo;.
An easy first read to inaugurate my presidential biography project. This chronologically approached Washington&amp;rsquo;s mythos and pointed out fact from fiction. I got the impression the author didn&amp;rsquo;t care for Washington&amp;rsquo;s legendary status and wanted readers to see him more as fellow man. All my heroes are dead.</description>

      <description>Part One AND Part Two This one is pretty funny. The author has managed to squeeze bingo into the story.
The input is both a list of numbers and boards. The goal is to figure out at which number call-out a board bingos. Part one asks for the board that bingos first. Part two asks for the one that bingos last.
Some notes &amp;hellip;
 In this version of bingo, bingo comes from completing only a row or column.</description>

      <description>Part One and Two As always, read the problem text first. In summary, the input is a list of line segments made by two points. The goal is to count the number of points where at least two lines overlap.
The data uses some simplifications &amp;hellip;
 Each line is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal (slope of 1 or -1)0. Everything happens on integer coordinates. Every line fits within a known square box.</description>

      <description>Part One AND Part Two As always, read the problem text first. In summary, the goal is to model the growth of splitting fish. At 0 days away from splitting one fish becomes two. One of the new fish is 6 days away from splitting and the second is 8 days away.
The output to part one is the total number of fish on day 80. Part two is the total number of fish on day 256.</description>

      <description>Part One And Two As always, read the problem text first. In summary, part one and two are optimization problems.
In part one the goal is to find a number (X) that minimizes the sum of distances to elements in a set (A) ∑|A - X|. The goal of part two is to minimize the square distance0 ∑((A - X)^2 + |A - X|)/2.
(0) This exact formula comes from finite arithmetic series.</description>

      <description>Part One As always, read the problem text first.
In summary, part one asks to identify “low cells” in a grid. A low cell has a value less than all cells next to it. The output takes all low cells, changes them by adding 1, and sums.
Solving Part One This solution requires multiple sheets.
Given a map of data0 &amp;hellip;
 A1=6A1=2A1=3 A1=7A1=4A1=5 A1=6A1=5A1=9 MAP  (0) Each digit gets a cell via Python.</description>
