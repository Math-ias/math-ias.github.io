    <h1 id="reading-every-presidential-biography">Reading Every
    Presidential Biography</h1>
    <p>I’m trying to read a biography for every president of the
    United States. This is a directory of all my reviews.</p>
    <p>I started this project in 2022 when I started my first full
    time job. I lived in Brookline and my work office was an hour
    away by green-line tram. At the time, I was wrestling with
    control.<sup>0</sup> Sitting stuck in a metal box for two hours
    wouldn’t do. So I copied lots of other green line riders. I
    transported myself someplace else with books. Now I needed to
    pick a genre. I love long-form projects.<sup>1</sup> Inching
    that progress bar forward every day is intoxicating to me. I
    love the United States. Being born in Massachusetts, I grew up
    on public television.<sup>2</sup> That cultural influence still
    runs through my veins as hot-blooded patriotism. And so I came
    upon the idea of tracking our presidents.</p>
    <div class="small">
      <p>(0) Something I only know now after reflection.</p>
      <p>(1) Like … <a href=
      "./running/runningbrookline.html">running every street</a> in
      my town.</p>
      <p>(2) Watching <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_(TV_series)&amp;oldid=1261583718">
      Arthur</a> every morning was formative.</p>
    </div>
    <p>I did the most important thing for any project. <strong>I
    started</strong>. I picked a thin book about George Washington
    with a cheeky title: You Never Forget Your First. I was more
    ambitious with the second president: McCullough’s John Adams
    biography. This was a heavy book that prompted me to get an
    ereader. EReaders are lightweight and don’t make you look like
    an egotist. In April of 2023 my coworker gifted me an old road
    bike. I cut my commute down to only 30 minutes<sup>3</sup>.
    That new hour of life enabled me to push harder in work and my
    personal life. The only loss was I started reading much less.
    Now I save reading for long commuter rail trips, and when I
    have trouble sleeping.</p>
    <div class="small">
      (3) Both an indictment of <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Green_Line_(MBTA)&amp;oldid=1255283771">
      Boston’s green line</a> and a credit to <a href=
      "https://www.boston.gov/departments/boston-bikes/better-bike-lanes">
      Boston’s bike infrastructure</a> (which is only getting
      better!).
    </div>
    <p>Still, at a conservative estimate of of a book a year I’ll
    catch up in about 47 years<sup>4</sup>.</p>
    <div class="small">
      (4) 45 unique presidents as of 2025 and I’m assuming that
      rate can be treated constant (elimination of term limits and
      assassinations may happen again). I can model the expected
      number of presidents by year <code>y</code> as
      <code>45/(2025-1789) * (y - 1789) = p</code>. The expected
      number of presidents books read can be modeled as <code>p = y
      - 2025 + 7</code>. These are expected to line up in <code>y =
      2071.95288 ≈ 2072</code>.

    <p>These mirror my <a href=
    "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/178730024-mathias-kools">goodreads</a>
    profile. In the interest of time I don’t do heavy editing,
    instead I give off-the-cuff reactions.</p>
